// written by Austin Blanchard
// this class respresents a deck of cards
// When a Deck is constructed, it contains 52 cards
// in a "regular" order (aces, twos, threes, ... , kings)
//
// Shuffling a deck makes it consist of 52 cards in a random order
//
// dealCard() returns a card from the deck and decreases the
// number of cards in the deck (returned by size())
// The idea is that after shuffling, calling dealCard() 52 times
// returns each card in the deck after shuffling.
//
// Calling shuffle again replenishes the deck with 52 cards.
